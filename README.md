# cypress-pollyjs

A currently non-working example of using Cypress and PollyJs together.

#Aim
To be able to add PollyJs to Cypress to improve development and test workflow by:

* easily record test stubs for Cypress tests
* help keep test stubs up to date with underlying APIs
* get some certainty over our contracts at the boundaries
